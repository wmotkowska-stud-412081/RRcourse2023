    theme_minimal()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summ <- data %>% 
    group_by(season) %>% 
    summarise(max_value = max(value)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    column_to_rownames(var="season")

summ

ses15 <- summ["season 15", "max_value"]
ses20 <- summ["season 20", "max_value"]

```

The search trend for KUWTK drops from `r ses15` to `r ses20` however for the new show it gets maximum value 100.
